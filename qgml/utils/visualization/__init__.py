"""
QGML Visualization Package

Comprehensive visualization tools for quantum geometric analysis.

This package provides visualization utilities for:
    - Manifold plotting and embedding visualization
    - Training progress and loss curves
    - Quantum state visualization
    - Berry curvature and topological field plots

Modules:
    manifold_plots: Manifold and embedding visualizations
    training_plots: Training progress and metrics visualization
